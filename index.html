        <p>With a background in international relations I have worked for several NGOs mostly in Africa until I decided to leave the non-profit space to figure out if there is another way of making a difference in this world without always having to raise money first. I have worked as a project manager for several projects around the world and I became more and more interested in learning how to build great products myself. I think technology really can change the world for the better and I want to be a part of that change.</p>
